# Claude Development State - TuMee VSCode Plugin

## Current Status
Date: 2025-01-25
Last Task: Fixed guard tag parser scope resolution (block and file scopes)

## Todo List Status

### âœ… Completed Tasks
1. Replace all inline regex compilation with cached patterns
2. Update CLI timeout handling for slow startup
3. Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback
4. Create CodeGuard acceptance test with timeout handling
5. Fix Node.js deprecation warning (fs.rmdir â†’ fs.rm)
6. Add integration tests with real CodeGuard CLI
7. Implement ACL query result caching (5 minute TTL)
8. Add configuration option for debounce delay (100-1000ms)
9. Make MAX_FILE_SIZE configurable (100KB-10MB)
10. Process large files in chunks with progress indication
11. Implement partial cache invalidation for scope resolution
12. Add telemetry and performance monitoring with output channel
13. Implement configuration validation with auto-fix capabilities
14. Move heavy operations to background processing with progress
15. Fix decoration flashing when switching tabs
16. Fix context guard scope to trim trailing empty lines
17. Fix color customizer theme saving/loading (namespace issue: guardTags â†’ tumee-vscode-plugin)
18. Fix guard tag parser scope resolution:
    - Block scope guards in comments now correctly apply to the next code block
    - File scope guards preserve permissions for all whitespace (no trailing whitespace trimming)
    - Removed incorrect comment block detection that was breaking block scope
    - Guards with .block scope search forward for next code block unless another guard is hit first
    - Fixed tree-sitter to include object literals as valid block nodes
    - Made tree-sitter authoritative - no regex fallback for supported languages
19. Fix default state decoration (aiRead_humanWrite):
    - No decoration created for default state - no background, no border
    - Lines with default permissions appear completely undecorated
20. Fix tree-sitter block scope end position:
    - Tree-sitter endPosition is exclusive (points after last character)
    - When endPosition.column is 0, the node actually ends on the previous line
    - Now correctly includes closing braces/brackets in block scope
21. Fix proxy error in color customizer theme deletion:
    - VSCode configuration objects are proxies that don't allow direct property deletion
    - Fixed by creating a shallow copy of customThemes object before deleting properties
    - Prevents "trap result does not reflect extensibility of proxy target" error

### ðŸš€ In Progress
- **None currently** - Ready for next task

### ðŸ“‹ Pending Tasks (Priority Order)
1. **Add CI/CD pipeline configuration** (Low)
2. **Create user documentation and README** (Low - after all code)
3. **Package and prepare for VSCode marketplace** (Low - after all code)

## Performance Improvements Implemented

### Configuration Options Added:
- `decorationUpdateDelay` - Adjustable debounce (100-1000ms, default 300ms)
- `maxFileSize` - Configurable file size limit (100KB-10MB, default 1MB)
- `enableChunkedProcessing` - Toggle chunk processing (default true)
- `chunkSize` - Lines per chunk (100-5000, default 1000)
- `enablePerformanceMonitoring` - Toggle performance tracking (default false)

### Performance Features:
1. **ACL Query Caching** - 5-minute TTL cache with intelligent invalidation
2. **Chunked Processing** - Large files processed in configurable chunks
3. **Partial Cache Invalidation** - Only invalidates modified lines
4. **Performance Monitoring** - Track operation timings with reporting
5. **Progress Indicators** - Shows progress for files >10,000 lines
6. **Configuration Validation** - Validates settings with auto-fix for common issues
7. **Background Processing** - Heavy operations run asynchronously with progress
8. **Flash-Free Tab Switching** - Caches decorations to eliminate flashing when switching tabs

### New Commands:
- `Show Performance Report` - Display performance metrics in output channel

## Key Files Modified
- `/src/utils/regexCache.ts` - Added PARSE_GUARD_TAG, UTILITY_PATTERNS
- `/src/utils/acl.ts` - Uses cached regex patterns
- `/src/utils/index.ts` - Uses UTILITY_PATTERNS for path ops
- `/src/extension.ts` - Uses UTILITY_PATTERNS.LINE_SPLIT
- `/src/utils/scopeResolver.ts` - Uses cached patterns
- `/src/utils/configValidator.ts` - NEW: Configuration validation with auto-fix
- `/src/utils/backgroundProcessor.ts` - NEW: Background task processing
- `/src/utils/performanceMonitor.ts` - NEW: Performance tracking and reporting

## Important Notes
- CodeGuard CLI has ~5.5 second cold start time
- Tree-sitter parsers are already lazy-loaded (good!)
- Regex caching shows 58% performance improvement
- Extension passes all ESLint checks
- All tests passing including acceptance tests

## Memories
- Never commit changes without testing
- Always quote shell paths
- This is the proper way to handle confirmations in VSCode extensions since the webview environment doesn't support native browser dialogs like confirm(), alert(), or prompt().

## Commands to Run
```bash
# Compile and lint
npm run compile && npm run lint

# Run tests
