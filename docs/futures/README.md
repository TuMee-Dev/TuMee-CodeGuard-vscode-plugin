# Future Features and Ideas

This folder contains planned enhancements, architectural improvements, and experimental concepts for the TuMee CodeGuard extension.

## Folder Structure

### `prior/`
Historical documents from earlier development phases:
- **Architecture plans**: Early system design documents
- **Refactoring ideas**: Performance and code organization improvements
- **Context management**: Advanced context-aware features
- **Integration concepts**: Ideas for deeper VS Code integration

### `specification_extend_1.md`
Extended specification document outlining future capabilities and enhancements beyond the current implementation.

## Planned Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Context Management
- **Scope**: Enhanced context awareness for guard tags
- **Features**: Semantic understanding, cross-file dependencies
- **Timeline**: Future major version

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- **Scope**: Further performance improvements
- **Features**: Background processing, incremental parsing
- **Timeline**: Ongoing improvements

### 3. Enhanced Gitignore Intelligence
- **Scope**: More sophisticated workspace analysis
- **Features**: Framework detection, custom templates
- **Timeline**: CLI implementation dependent

### 4. Integration Improvements
- **Scope**: Deeper VS Code integration
- **Features**: Custom views, enhanced UI elements
- **Timeline**: Based on user feedback

## Development Priorities

1. **Complete CLI Implementation**: Finish RPC command implementation
2. **User Experience**: Polish based on real-world usage
3. **Performance**: Address any performance bottlenecks
4. **Advanced Features**: Implement items from this folder

## Contributing Ideas

When adding new concepts to this folder:
1. **Clear scope definition**: What problem does it solve?
2. **Implementation complexity**: High-level effort estimate
3. **Dependencies**: What needs to exist first?
4. **User value**: Clear benefit to extension users

## Migration Path

Features move from `futures/` to active development when:
- **User demand**: Clear request from extension users
- **Technical readiness**: Dependencies are satisfied
- **Resource availability**: Development capacity exists
- **Strategic alignment**: Fits overall product direction
