# TuMee File and Folder Customization for VS Code

A Visual Studio Code extension that customizes your files and folders based on human/AI editability attributes. Set colors, badges, or tooltips for any file or folder in your workspace based on ACL rules.

## Features

- Set custom colors, badges, and tooltips for files and folders
- Visually distinguish between human-editable and AI-editable files and folders
- Highlight code regions based on @GUARD tags with different colors
- Automatically detect ACL settings using CodeGuard CLI
- Apply colors based on detected ACL permissions
- Context menu for easy configuration

### Human and AI Colorization

This extension integrates with the CodeGuard ACL system to automatically colorize files and folders based on their human/AI access permissions:

- ðŸŸ¢ **Human-Editable**: Files that are editable by humans only
- ðŸŸ£ **AI-Editable**: Files that are editable by AI only
- ðŸ”µ **Both Human and AI Editable**: Files that can be edited by both

### Code Region Highlighting

The extension highlights code regions based on @guard tags with different colors:

- ðŸŸ¢ **Human-editable regions**: Light green background
- ðŸŸ£ **AI-editable regions**: Light purple background
- ðŸ”µ **Both human and AI editable**: Light blue background

Example of guard tag usage:

```js
// @guard:ai:r
// This region can only be read by AI (AI read-only)
function aiReadOnlyFunction() {
    // AI can read but not modify this code
}

// @guard:ai:w
// This region can be written by AI (AI can edit)
function aiWritableFunction() {
    // AI can modify this code
}

// @guard:ai:n
// This region cannot be accessed by AI at all
const noAiAccessConfig = {
    // AI should not use or reference this code
};
```

#### Markdown Files

For markdown files, guard tags must be placed inside HTML comments to be recognized:

```markdown
<!-- @guard:ai:r -->
This markdown content is read-only for AI.

<!-- @guard:ai:w.5 -->
This content and the next 4 lines can be edited by AI.
Line 2 of 5
Line 3 of 5
Line 4 of 5
Line 5 of 5

<!-- @guard:ai:n -->
This content is not accessible to AI.
```

Guard tags that appear in regular markdown text (not in HTML comments) will not be recognized or highlighted.

The permissions follow the CodeGuard format:
- `@guard:ai:r` - AI Read-Only (can read but not modify) - no highlighting
- `@guard:ai:w` - AI Write (can read and modify) - red highlighting (#F44336)
- `@guard:ai:n` - AI None (should not access at all) - green highlighting (#4CAF50)

#### Line Count Feature

You can also specify a line count to limit the scope of a guard tag:
- `@guard:ai:r.3` - Make the next 3 lines read-only for AI
- `@guard:ai:w.5` - Make the next 5 lines writable for AI
- `@guard:ai:n.1` - Make the next line inaccessible to AI

After the specified number of lines, permissions revert to the previous state. This is useful for protecting small sections of code without needing to add multiple guard tags.

By default, no assumptions are made about permissions - code is not highlighted. Guard tags explicitly set different permission levels when needed.

### Inserting Guard Tags

There are multiple ways to insert guard tags:

1. **Right-click menu**: Right-click in the editor and select one of the guard tag options
   - If you have text selected, the extension will automatically calculate the line count
   - If no text is selected, you'll be prompted for an optional line count
2. **Status bar indicator**: Click on the AI status indicator in the status bar to toggle between permissions
3. **Snippets**: Start typing `guard`, `guard-r`, `guard-w`, or `guard-n` to trigger snippets
4. **Command palette**: Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type "TuMee" to see available commands

When using the right-click menu, if you select multiple lines before inserting a guard tag, the extension will automatically add the appropriate line count to the tag.

The extension supports various comment styles across different programming languages:
```
// @guard:ai:r    (JavaScript/C/C++/Java)
# @guard:ai:r     (Python/Ruby/Shell)
<!-- @guard:ai:r --> (HTML/XML)
/* @guard:ai:r */ (CSS/C/Java block comment)
* @guard:ai:r     (JSDoc/PHPDoc)
-- @guard:ai:r    (SQL)
```

The extension also supports comments without spaces after the comment marker:
```
//@guard:ai:r     (No space after //)
#@guard:ai:r      (No space after #)
/*@guard:ai:r     (No space after /*)
--@guard:ai:r     (No space after --)
```

The opacity of the highlighting can be adjusted in the extension settings.

### Available Commands

- `Set Color`: Apply a custom color to files or folders
- `Set as Human-Editable`: Mark files or folders as human-editable and update ACL rules
- `Set as AI-Editable`: Mark files or folders as AI-editable and update ACL rules
- `Clear ACL Status`: Remove ACL status from files or folders
- `Set Text Badge`: Add a text badge (max 2 characters) to files or folders
- `Set Emoji Badge`: Add an emoji badge to files or folders
- `Set Tooltip`: Add a custom tooltip to files or folders
- `Clear Color/Badge/Tooltip`: Remove customizations
- `Reset Workspace`: Clear all customizations

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code v1.92.0 or higher
- CodeGuard CLI tool installed for ACL integration

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `tumee-vscode-plugin.colorChangedFiles`: Ignore any color customizations set by the IDE when in a Git repository
* `tumee-vscode-plugin.aclCliPath`: Path to the CodeGuard CLI tool for checking ACL status
* `tumee-vscode-plugin.codeDecorationOpacity`: The opacity of the code region decorations (0.0 to 1.0)
* `tumee-vscode-plugin.items`: Array of customized files and folders with their settings

## Installation

1. Install the extension through VS Code Marketplace
2. Configure the CodeGuard CLI path in settings if needed
3. Right-click on any file or folder to access the TuMee Customization menu

## Usage

### File and Folder Customization
1. Right-click on a file or folder in the VS Code Explorer
2. Select "TuMee Customization" from the context menu
3. Choose an option like "Set as Human-Editable" or "Set as AI-Editable"
4. The file or folder will be visually decorated and ACL rules will be updated

### Code Region Highlighting
1. Add @guard tags to your code files to specify editable regions
2. Use the following format:
   ```
   // @guard:ai:r  (for AI read-only regions)
   // @guard:ai:w  (for AI writable regions)
   // @guard:ai:n  (for regions AI should not access)
   ```
3. The extension will automatically highlight these regions with the appropriate colors
4. The line containing the @guard tag is included in the highlighted region
5. Regions end at the next @guard tag or the end of the file
